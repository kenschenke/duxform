# DuxForm

Low-complexity Form handling and processing for React / Redux applications.  I originally
developed this for a few web sites.  I played with a few other React
form frameworks but none met my needs.  They either did not offer
different data types or did not offer built-in Redux integration.  Some
required heavy customization to meet my needs or were overly complex.

## Notable Features

* Built-in Redux integration
* Native data types such as date and numbers
* Field-level and form-level validation with support for custom validation at both levels
* Custom value formatting, parsing, and normalization
* Support for checkboxes, radio buttons, &lt;textarea&gt;, and &lt;select&gt; tags
* Dropdown autocomplete lists

## Getting Started

*As soon as I get a NPM package together, I'll fill this in*

*Documentation and website are coming soon.*

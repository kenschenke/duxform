<h3>Delayed Validation</h3>

<p>
    Validating the field as the user types can be a little aggressive. Especially if the user is being provided
    feedback as they type.  It can be frustrating for users to be told their email address is invalid after typing
    just one letter.  The <code>idleValidateTimeout</code> and <code>onIdleValidate</code> properties of
    <code>DuxInput</code> allow processing to occur after the user stops typing.  This is the perfect time to
    validate the field value as a whole.  The onIdleValidate function returns an error string if the field is
    invalid or undefined if valid.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>idleValidateTimeout</code> property specifies the number of milliseconds to delay.  As the user continues to
    type, the timer is reset to 0.  The <code>onIdleValidate</code> function is called only after the user does not
    type anything for the specified number of milliseconds.  The function should return <strong>undefined</strong> if
    the field is valid or an error message string if invalid.

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>
    This example demonstrates validating an email address as the user types.  Validation does not occur until the
    user has not typed anything for at least 2 seconds.  Notice that if an invalid email address is typed and indicated
    as invalid, the error message goes away when the user starts typing again.  This is because the
    <code>DuxInput</code> component does not specify an <code>onValidate</code> callback.  Without this callback, the
    field is set to valid when changes occur.

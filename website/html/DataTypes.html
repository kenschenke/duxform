<h3>Data Types</h3>

<p>
    DuxForm supports three data types - string, number, and date.  Number and Date are handled as native JavaScript
    data types.  Data types are specified using the <code>dataType</code> property to <code>&lt;DuxInput&gt;</code>.
    If not specified, the default is <code>"str"</code>.
</p>

<h4>String</h4>

<p>
    This data type is the default.  It can be explicitly specified with the property <code>dataType="str"</code>.
    All characters are allowed.  There are two other properties that affect the handling of strings.
</p>

<table class="table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th>Default</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>trim</td>
        <td>true</td>
        <td>If true, leading and trailing whitespace are trimmed when the field loses focus.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>forceUpper</td>
        <td>false</td>
        <td>If true, alphabetic case is forced to uppercase when the field loses focus.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Number</h4>

<p>
    This data type is specified with the property <code>dataType="num"</code>.  The user is only allowed to type
    the characters 0 - 9, the period, the minus sign, and the dollar sign.  It is possible for other characters to be
    placed into the field by pasting from the clipboard but those other characters would be ignored.  Numbers are
    formatted based on properties of decimal precision, commas, and dollar signs according to how numbers are
    formatted in the United States.  Formatting is not performed as the user is typing but is done when the field
    loses focus.  Internationalization may be supported in future versions with no plans at
    this time.  Formatting is controlled with the following properties.
</p>

<table class="table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th>Default</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>precision</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>
            This controls not only how many digits are shown after the decimal point, but values are rounded
            according to this precision.  See the <code>round</code> property for more information.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>showCommas</td>
        <td>false</td>
        <td>If true, commas are used as a thousands separator when formatting the field.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>showDollar</td>
        <td>false</td>
        <td>If true, a United States dollar sign is put at the beginning of the field when formatting.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>round</td>
        <td>true</td>
        <td>
            If true, values are rounded using the <code>precision</code> property when saved in the Redux store.
            For example, if precision is 2 and the user types 12.336 the value is saved as 12.34 in the Redux
            store.  If precision is 0 and the user types 122.7 then 123 is stored.  The rounding occurs when the
            field loses focus.  While the field has focus the value is stored as a string.
        </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Date</h4>

<p>
    This data type is specified with the property <code>dataType="date"</code>.  The user is only allowed to type the
    characters 0 - 9 and /.  It is possible for other characters to be placed into the field by pasting from the
    clipboard but those other characters would be ignored.  Dates are formatted according to United States standards.
    That is, month/day/year.  Internationalization may be supported in future versions with no plans at this time.
    The date is saved in the Redux store as a JavaScript timestamp.  If no default value is specified for a date
    field, today's date is used.

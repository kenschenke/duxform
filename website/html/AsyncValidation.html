<h3>Asynchronous Validation</h3>

<p>
    Because field validation functions must be very quick and low-resource, server-based Asynchronous validation
    cannot be done inside these callbacks.  It can be implemented using a simple workaround.  The application
    connects to the field's <code>onBlur</code> handler and keeps track when the validation is started.  This
    technique is demonstrated below.

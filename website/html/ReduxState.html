<h3>Redux State</h3>

<p>
    DuxForm saves form state in the Redux store in the root <code>forms</code> object.  A reducer is used in the
    application's root reducer to manage the form state.  See the <strong>Getting Started</strong> topic for more
    information.
</p>

<h4>Basic Structure</h4>

<p>
    Beneath the <code>forms</code> object, an object is created for each <code>&lt;DuxForm&gt;</code> component in the
    application.  Each form's object is created when its <code>&lt;DuxForm&gt;</code> component is initialized.  Within
    that object, <code>valid</code>, <code>pristine</code>, and <code>error</code> properties are created to reflect state for the form as
    a whole.  <code>valid</code> is true as long as every field in the form is valid (see the Validation topic) and
    <code>pristine</code> is true as long as all fields in the form are pristine (their values are not modified). A
    <code>fields</code> object is also created.  Beneath that, objects are created for each field in the form.  The
    properties for each field are detailed later.  A typical Redux store might look like the following.
</p>

<pre>
    forms: {
        exampleform: {
            fields: {
                username: {
                    pristine: false,
                    value: "John Doe",
                    error: "",
                    valid: true,
                    hasFocus: true
                },
                email: {
                    pristine: true,
                    value: "",
                    error: "Email is missing",
                    valid: false,
                    hasFocus: false
                }
            },
            pristine: false,
            valid: false,
            error: ""
        },
        otherform: {
            ...
        },
        yetanotherform: {
            ...
        }
    }
</pre>

<p>
    In this example, the form is named <code>"exampleform"</code> with two fields: <code>"username"</code> and
    <code>"email"</code>.  The cursor is currently in the username field and the user has typed some text.  The email
    field is still empty and is invalid, making the entire form invalid.  Since the user has typed something in the
    first field, it is not pristine, making the entire form not pristine.
</p>

<h4>Field Properties</h4>

<p>
    Each field object stores properties for that field.  These properties are updated as the user interacts with the
    form.  Some of these properties are used internally by <code>&lt;DuxForm&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;DuxInput&gt;</code>
    and are considered read-only.  Others are updated by the components but can be changed in order to feed information
    back into the form.  The following properties are maintained for each field.
</p>

<table class="table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>pristine</td>
        <td>
            True if the field has not been changed from the default value.  This includes typing by the user,
            pasting into the field, or programatically changing the value.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>value</td>
        <td>
            The current value of the field.  For <code>dataType="num"</code> fields, this is a native JavaScript
            integer or floating point value.  For <code>dataType="data"</code> fields, this is a JavaScript timestamp.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>error</td>
        <td>For field validation, this is an error message.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>valid</td>
        <td>
            For field validation, this is true or false to indicate validity.  If no validation callback is
            specified, this value is always true.  See the <strong>Validation</strong> topic for more information.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>hasFocus</td>
        <td>True if the field has current focus.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

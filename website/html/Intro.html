<p>
    DuxForm is a low-complexity form handling and processing framework for React / Redux applications.  I originally
    developed this for a few business applications.  I played with a few other React form frameworks but none met
    my needs.  They either did not offer different data types or did not offer built-in Redux integration.  Some
    required heavy customization to meet my needs or were overly complex.

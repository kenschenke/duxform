<h3>Formatting, Parsing, and Normalization</h3>

<p>
    The <code>&lt;DuxInput&gt;</code> component supports custom formatting, parsing, and normalization callbacks.
    A formatting callback is called upon to display a value in a format the user can easily read.  A parsing callback
    is called upon to read a string input by the user and convert it into a value saved in the Redux store.  A
    normalization callback is called upon to normalize the value input by the user into a the value saved in the
    Redux store.
</p>

<h4>Formatting</h4>

<p>
    A formatting callback is called when the input field blurs.  It formats the value from the Redux store to be
    displayed in the field input.  The function is passed the value and field name and returns the formatted value.
</p>

<h4>Parsing</h4>

<p>
    The parsing callback is called whenever the value changes, even as the user types.  It parses the value from the
    input field into the value you want saved in the Redux store.  The function is passed the value and the field
    name and returns the parsed value.
</p>

<h4>Normalization</h4>

<p>
    The normalization callback is called when the input field blurs.  This is useful when you want to alter the value
    the user enters before it gets stored in the Redux store.  For example, you could convert the string to all lowercase
    or remove special or undesired characters.  The function is passed the value and field name and it returns the
    normalized value.

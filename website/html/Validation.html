<h3>Validation</h3>

<p>
    You can supply your own custom validation functions at the field level and the form level.  Validation functions
    are called whenever a field changes value, even as the user is typing.  For this reason, they should execute quickly
    without accessing server resources.  See the topic on <strong>Asynchronous Validation</strong> for techniques you
    can use to validate against server resources or validation that might not be immediate or resource friendly.
</p>

<p>
    Validation callbacks are specified with the <code>onValidate</code> property to the <code>&lt;DuxForm&gt;</code> and
    <code>&lt;DuxInput&gt;</code> components.  If the field or form is not valid, and error message string is returned.
    If valid, <code>undefined</code> is returned.
</p>

<h4>Idle Validation</h4>

<p>
    Validating the field as the user types can be a little aggressive. Especially if the user is being provided
    feedback as they type.  It can be frustrating for users to be told their email address is invalid after typing
    just one letter.  See the section on <strong>Delayed Validation</strong> for more information and an example.
</p>

<h4>Field Validation</h4>

<pre>
    const validateAge = (value, fieldName, formName) => {
        if (value &lt; 0 || value &gt; 120) {
            return "Age out of range";
        }
    };

    &lt;DuxInput onValidate={validateAge}/&gt;
</pre>

<h4>Form Validation</h4>

<pre>
    const validateForm = (values, formName) => {
        if (values.country === "USA" && values.phone.length !== 10) {
            return "Phone numbers in the United States must be 10 digits long";
        }
    };

    &lt;DuxForm onValidate={validateForm}&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/DuxForm&gt;
</pre>

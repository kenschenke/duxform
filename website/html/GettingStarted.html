<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>
    If you're the ready, fire, aim type (aren't all programmers?), you should find everything you need on this page
    to start using DuxForm.
</p>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<pre>
    npm install duxform
</pre>

<p>
    If you are using the <code>&lt;DuxAutoComplete&gt;</code> component, you also need to link to the
    <code>duxautocomplete.css</code> file in the <code>dist/</code> directory.
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="duxautocomplete.css"/&gt;
</pre>

<h4>Redux Store</h4>

<p>
    DuxForm stores form state in the Redux store.  It requires the root <code>form</code> object in the store.
    A reducer is supplied to manage this.
</p>

<pre>
    import {DuxFormReducer} from 'duxform';

    const appReducer = combineReducers({
        ...  // other reducers
        forms: DuxFormReducer
    });
</pre>

<h4>Browser Requirements</h4>

<p>
    DuxForm doesn't place any special requirements on browser support.  It has been tested on the modern evergreen
    browsers (Chrome and Firefox) as well as Internet Explorer 10 and 11.  I know for a fact it won't work on
    Internet Explorer 8 or earlier.  The <code>&lt;DuxAutoComplete&gt;</code> component uses
    <a href="https://fontawesome.com">Font Awesome</a> icons which require Internet Explorer 10 or 11.
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>
    Here is a really brief example.  It demonstrates a couple of fields and a onSubmit handler to process the
    form submission.  The current Redux store is shown to the right of the form.  Try hitting the Enter key in the
    fields.

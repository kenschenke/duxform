<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>
    If you're the ready, fire, aim type (aren't all programmers?), you should find everything you need on this page
    to start using DuxForm.
</p>

<p>
    This package consists of three React components: <code>&lt;DuxForm&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;DuxInput&gt;</code>, and
    <code>&lt;DuxAutoComplete&gt;</code>.  DuxForm and DuxInput are thin wrappers around <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> and
    <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>.  All attributes such as <code>method</code>, <code>target</code>,
    or <code>className</code> are passed along to the underlying HTML tags.
</p>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<pre>
    npm install duxform
</pre>

<p>
    If you are using the <code>&lt;DuxAutoComplete&gt;</code> component, you also need to link to the
    <code>duxautocomplete.css</code> file in the <code>node_modules/duxform/website/dist/</code> directory.
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="duxautocomplete.css"/&gt;
</pre>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    You might be tempted to use the duxautocomplete.css file in your project with webpack and an import statement.
    This will work as long as you don't need to override any of the CSS in the file.
</div>

<h4>Redux Store</h4>

<p>
    DuxForm stores form state in the Redux store.  It requires the root <code>form</code> object in the store.
    A reducer is supplied to manage this.
</p>

<pre>
    import {DuxFormReducer} from 'duxform';

    const appReducer = combineReducers({
        ...  // other reducers
        forms: DuxFormReducer
    });
</pre>

<h4>Browser Requirements</h4>

<p>
    DuxForm doesn't place any special requirements on browser support.  It has been tested on the modern evergreen
    browsers (Chrome and Firefox) as well as Internet Explorer 10 and 11.  It definitely won't work on
    Internet Explorer 8 or earlier.
</p>

<h4>Example</h4>

<p>
    Here is a really brief example.  It demonstrates a couple of fields and a onSubmit handler to process the
    form submission.  The current Redux store is shown to the right of the form.  Try hitting the Enter key in the
    fields.
